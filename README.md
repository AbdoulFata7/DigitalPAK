# Port - Real-Time Concession Monitoring Platform

## Context
In an increasingly dynamic world, it is crucial for managers to have up-to-date information about the real situation on the ground. Unlike its predecessor, Desktop GIS, mobile GIS allows people in the field to collect, store, update, and even analyze geospatial data and information in real-time. 
Mobile GIS bridges the gap between field realities and office work, enabling effective decision-making synchronized with on-the-ground realities.

## Project Context
The Port grants concessions to companies to set up and store their equipment. In return, these companies make payments and commit to occupying the spaces for specific purposes.
To optimize the management of the port domain, PAK decided to develop a web platform for real-time monitoring of all its concessions. This platform will be enriched by data collectors who will gather information in their assigned sectors, including taking photographs of the sites. The collected information will document the utilization status of each allocated concession, ensuring optimal use of the port areas and providing real-time information for enhancing the port information system platform.
